# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project demonstrates the capability of Excel to analyze data and uncover trends relating to Kickstarter campaign data.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to assist a client (Louise) in deciding if or when to start a crowdfunding Kickstarter campaign for her play Fever.
## Analysis and Challenges
To create a palatable view of the project it was broken down into two main deliverables, outcomes based on launch date and outcomes based on goals.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The purpose of this analysis was to look at outcomes from the parent category of "theater" campaigns which was then further broken down into a subcategory of "plays", these were then filtered by year and month the campaigns started in. To achieve this, a pivot table was created to look at the "theater" category, the start month/year of every campaign, and the outcomes of the campaigns. The pivot table was filtered for "parent category" and "years", launch date for rows, and "outcomes" for values and columns. Once the pivot table was complete, it was used to create a line chart to visually show the outcomes based on which month the campaign began.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
