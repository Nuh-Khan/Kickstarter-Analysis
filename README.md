# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysing Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns to determine viability of project.
## Overview of project
Looking at the Kickstarter data we wanted to determine the viability of a theater play Kickstater campaign. First by taking all of the Kickstarter data then breaking it into catogoreys and subcatogoreys. Further we broke the data down into country and by start and end date of the campaigns. Then by filtering the data for the country (US) and subcatogory (plays) further analysis was able to be conducted. The data was broken down into visualization models and tables.
